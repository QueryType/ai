# üñ•Ô∏è Screen Capture Mode - Use Cases & Examples

This guide covers the screen capture feature - perfect for analyzing your Mac screen in real-time!

## What is Screen Capture Mode?

Instead of using your webcam, the app can capture your Mac screen (or specific windows) and analyze what's displayed. This is incredibly useful for:

- **Coding assistance** - Get help with code on your screen
- **Document analysis** - Read and summarize documents you're viewing
- **Presentation feedback** - Get real-time feedback on your slides
- **Accessibility** - Have your screen content described
- **Learning** - Get explanations of content you're studying
- **Productivity** - Analyze workflows and provide suggestions

## How to Use Screen Capture

1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. **Select "üñ•Ô∏è Screen Capture"** from the Input Source dropdown
3. Configure your prompt (see examples below)
4. Click **‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start**
5. macOS will show a dialog - choose what to share:
   - **Entire Screen** - Capture everything
   - **Window** - Capture a specific app window
   - **Chrome Tab** - Capture just a browser tab (in Chrome)

**Pro Tip:** Choose "Window" to share only your code editor or the specific app you want analyzed!

## üéØ Optimizing Screen Capture Performance

### Recommended Settings

**For Code/Text (Fast, Frequent Updates):**
```
Interval: 1000ms - 2000ms
Instruction: Short and specific
Quality: Can be lower for text
```

**For Detailed Analysis (Design, Complex Data):**
```
Interval: 2000ms - 5000ms
Instruction: Comprehensive
Quality: Higher capture rate
```

**For Real-time Demos/Presentations:**
```
Interval: 500ms - 1000ms
Instruction: Focus on changes or key points
Quality: Balanced
```

### Performance Tips

1. **Share Only What's Needed**
   - Use "Window" mode instead of entire screen
   - Close unnecessary applications
   - Reduces processing load

2. **Adjust Interval Based on Content**
   - Static code: 2000ms is fine
   - Active typing: 1000ms for more updates
   - Slide presentations: 3000-5000ms

3. **Optimize Your Prompt**
   - Shorter prompts = faster responses
   - Be specific about what you want
   - Avoid asking for multiple analyses at once

4. **Model Selection**
   - Qwen2-VL-2B: Good balance for screen content
   - Qwen2-VL-7B: Better for complex analysis
   - SmolVLM: Fast for simple text extraction

## üîí Privacy Considerations

When using screen capture mode:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Be aware of sensitive information** - The model sees everything on your screen
- ‚úÖ **All processing is local** - Nothing is sent to the cloud
- ‚úÖ **Share specific windows** - Not your entire screen when possible
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Close sensitive tabs/apps** - Before starting capture
- ‚úÖ **Stop sharing when done** - Don't leave it running unnecessarily

**Remember:** Unlike the webcam, screen capture can see:
- Passwords being typed
- Private messages
- Confidential documents
- Personal information

Always use "Window" mode when working with sensitive content!

## üéì Creative Use Cases

### Programming Assistant
```
Window: VS Code
Interval: 1500ms
Prompt: "Review this code. If there are errors, explain them. If it looks good, suggest optimizations."
```

### Live Translation
```
Window: Web Browser
Interval: 2000ms
Prompt: "Translate any non-English text to English. If screen is in English, say 'All English'."
```

### Study Buddy
```

Interval: 3000ms
Prompt: "Explain the key concept on this page in simple terms. Create a memorable analogy."
```

### Design Critique Bot
```

Interval: 2000ms
Prompt: "If this is a function/class, write a brief docstring for it. If it's a command, explain what it does."
```

### Meeting Assistant
```
Window: Zoom/Meet
Interval: 5000ms
Prompt: "Who's speaking? What's the current topic? Any action items mentioned?"
```

## üöÄ Advanced Tips

### JSON Output for Automation
```json
{
  "content_type": "code/document/presentation",
  "language": "python",
  "issues": ["issue1", "issue2"],
  "suggestions": ["suggestion1"],
  "confidence": 0.95
}
```

### Chain Multiple Analyses
Switch prompts every few cycles:
1. Cycle 1-3: "What's on screen?"
2. Cycle 4-6: "Any errors or issues?"
3. Cycle 7-9: "Suggest improvements"

### Context-Aware Prompts
```
Remember the previous 3 frames. Has anything changed? 
If yes, explain what changed. If no, say "No changes".
```

## üìä Comparison: Screen Capture vs Webcam

| Feature | Webcam | Screen Capture |

| Privacy | Shows physical space | Shows digital workspace |
| Use Cases | Security, detection, AR | Programming, learning, productivity |
| Frame Rate | Can be higher (100ms+) | Usually lower (1000ms+) |
| Resolution | 720p-1080p typical | Full screen resolution |
| Selection | Single camera | Screen/Window/Tab |

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Screen Capture

**Permission Denied?**
- Go to System Preferences ‚Üí Security & Privacy ‚Üí Screen Recording
- Allow your browser to record screen

- Try sharing a different window
- Check if app has DRM protection

**Performance Issues?**
- Increase interval to 2000ms or more
- Share a single window, not entire screen
- Close other applications
- Use a smaller model
