### 🔍 [Gospel Embeddings](./gospel_embeddings)
Semantic search system for The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna using Google's EmbeddingGemma model, ChromaDB vector database, and MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration. Includes 7,862 high-quality text chunks with advanced semantic search capabilities.

### 🖼️ [Llama Server Multimodal](./llama-server-multimodal)
Multimodal image analyzer and tagger that automatically analyzes images using OpenAI-compatible APIs. Supports multiple tagging styles including simple descriptions, booru-style tags, NSFW classification, artistic analysis, and weather forecast analysis.

### 🔧 [MCP Tools](./mcp)
Programs and utilities built on the Model Context Protocol (MCP) for AI agent integration.

### 🕉️ [MymicroGPT](./mymicroGPT)
A pure Python, zero-dependency GPT that learns Devanagari character patterns from Indian names and generates new, plausible-sounding Sanskrit/Hindi names. Based on Karpathy's microgpt architecture with a custom autograd engine, character-level tokenizer for Devanagari Unicode, and a ~32K name dataset spanning historical figures, mythology, and Sanskrit vocabulary. No pip install required.

### 📹 [Real-time Webcam & Screen Capture](./rt_webcam_scr)
A powerful web-based interface for real-time vision model analysis using webcam or screen capture. Works with any OpenAI-compatible vision API with features like frame skipping, performance metrics, and advanced logging.

### 📚 [Story Chunker](./story_chunker)
Extract specific topics, themes, or subjects from story files using AI. Perfect for researchers, writers, and educators working with large text files who need to find and extract specific content based on topics or themes.

### 📝 [Story Summarizer](./story_summarizer)
A sophisticated multi-agent workflow system for intelligent story summarization built with Strands Agents SDK. Uses sequential agents for character analysis, content analysis, summary generation, and title creation.

### 🔊 [TTS Krutrim](./tts_krutrim)
A simple web application using Krutrim's TTS API to convert text to speech. Built with Gradio, supporting multiple languages (English, Hindi) and speaker voices.
